Business goal: can we affect profit margin by adjusting our fleets?
Data Exploration - What is my model going to be about?
The company wants to make better business decisions

Iâ€™m going to look into each car and see how much each car is costing them
I want to find out the best and worst selling car and improve profit margin.

Come up with 2 strategies:
-What if we stopped selling the worst selling car + and we increase profit margin 30% as a new KPI
-What if we doubled the best selling car amount
-Combined both strategies to see a better end result

Present the analyzed data:
-What cars on the fleet were the most booked - "Most popular amongst our clients" 
-What Care on the fleet were the least booked and removed them from the fleet to help with cost
-Are we able to have a trackable goal to achieve this. 1 year, 2 years?
